- TASK: finish and improve the existing code in the Manual_Creature_Creator Class.

* The code is here: http://pastebin.com/Xuy879m3
* The methods should have complete data validation.
* Every paramether should be created in a separate Method.
* It should have methods for the following data: Gender, Size, Age, Hero Specialisation (Warrior, Mage), 
Hero Sub-Specialisation (Veteran, Tribesman for *Warrior* and Healer, White Wizard for *Mage*).

* The main purpose of this class is to ask the user specific, leading questions and taking his answers create all the 
necessary data for a custom Hero, which will then be used to create the duel (main game idea).
